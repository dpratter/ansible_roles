About
=====

This is a collection of common ansible roles to use with vagrant or actual 
deployments.


Installation
============

Clone the roles in this repository:

    git clone <git repo> ~/.ansible/roles

Note, that this command copies the roles to the ~/.ansible/roles directory.
This is the recommended location for shared ansible roles, but you can choose
any other location you like.

Make sure the ansible.cfg file in your project (in the root directory next to
the Vagrantfile) contains the roles_path setting:

    [defaults]
    roles_path = /etc/ansible/roles/:~/.ansible/roles/

Alternatively you can create your own configuration file in your home
directory: ~/.ansible.cfg and add that line, including your custom roles
location.


Contributing
============

When modifying an existing role changes should be pushed to a feature
branch for review. Only after compatibility of the changes has been tested
in *all* projects using the role, it should be accepted into master.

Specialized roles only suitable to a specific project should be kept in 
the project repository.
