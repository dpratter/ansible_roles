About
=====

This is a collection of common ansible roles to use with vagrant or actual 
deployments.


Installation
============

Paths used in the following steps are recommendations.

Clone the roles in this repository:

    git clone <git repo> ~/.ansible/roles

Make sure the ansible.cfg file in your project has the following setting:

    [defaults]
    roles_path = /etc/ansible/:~/.ansible/

If not create a file ~/.ansible.cfg and add that line.


Contributing
============

When modifying an existing role changes should be pushed to a feature
branch for review. Only after compatibility of the changes has been tested
in *all* projects using the role, it should be accepted into master.

Specialized roles only suitable to a specific project should be kept in 
the project repository.
